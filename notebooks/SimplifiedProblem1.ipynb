Let's assume that this distribution has a functional form and can be described by a set of parameters $\\vec{\\eta}$. We call these the *hyper-parameters*.\n",

It doesn't matter that some objects don't have weak lensing data and some other objects don't have kinematics, we just drop the corresponding term in the likelihood."
